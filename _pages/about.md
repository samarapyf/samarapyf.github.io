Samara Pyfrom is an accomplished Environmental Science and Geography major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. As a distinguished Meyerhoff Scholar, Samara is actively engaged in promoting diversity within the STEM field. While focusing on environmental science, their true passion lies in advocating for environmental justice.

With a strong commitment to addressing the inequalities arising from environmental racism, Samara has undertaken extensive research and community engagement. Her experiences include serving as an assistant teacher for the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, delivering Weather and Climate courses to first-grade students in Baltimore City's public schools. Additionally, she has taken a leadership role in Patuxent River Park's "Watershed Connection" programs, enlightening elementary students from marginalized communities in Prince George's and Montgomery counties about the Chesapeake Bay.

Samara has already made significant contributions to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, having served as a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice intern. They completed a GIS native land acknowledgment project and fostered partnerships with minority organizations. Recognizing her unwavering dedication to environmental justice and the restoration of the Bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation invited Samara to serve as a member of their board of trustees.

In pursuit of further knowledge and expertise, Samara participated in a GIS research project at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. Through this experience, she explored the impact of legacy pollutants on soil lead levels in Philadelphia, with a particular focus on areas where children might be exposed to lead contamination. By mapping historical pollution sites and their proximity to current risk areas, Samara contributed valuable insights into this pressing issue.

Motivated by her own experiences as a child attending Chesapeake Bay field trips and camps, Samara recognizes the importance of representation in science. By teaching and inspiring young students who share their background, they serve as a role model and advocate for underrepresented minorities and girls in the scientific community.

Upon completing their undergraduate studies, Samara aspires to delve deeper into the intersection of environmental and climate sciences, investigating the ways in which these fields disproportionately impact marginalized communities. With a vision to effect positive change, Samara aims to develop innovative solutions and promote equity, justice, and equal opportunities within the environmental sphere.

Driven by a global perspective, Samara envisions their research and solutions to have far-reaching implications, not only locally and nationally but also as a model for environmental justice efforts worldwide. With her expertise, dedication, and the support of this program, Samara seeks to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
